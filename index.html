	  <h1>I JUST HIT SOMEONE WITH MY CAR</h1>
    <p>The title is completely unrelated to what I wish to infodump here today. I have been thinking a
    lot about an original character of mine that goes by the name <strong>Zeedee</strong>. She is a 
    unicorn--sometimes anthropomorphized--and is based on the ponies that appear in the animated tv 
    show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic">My Little Pony: 
    Friendship is Magic.</a> Her special talents include tinkering with machines and artistic work. 
    She loves to combine her magic with machinery to create special gadgets for any situation. Zeedee 
    is most well known for her mechanical limbs that she uses on a daily basis. <strong>I love Zeedee 
    a normal amount.</strong></p>
